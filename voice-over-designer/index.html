    <h2>Design UI that is accessible for blind people in a minutes</h2>

    <p>
    VoiceOver Designer is a macOS-app to design accessible layout for different kinds of accessibility technologies. Create the layout and open it at iOS-app VoiceOver Preview to hear your design.</p>

    <div class="features">
      <article>
        <h3>Markup over a screenshot of your UI</h3>
        <p>
          Just draw rectangles to specify place of accessible elements. Yes, just so simple.
        </p>

          <source
          srcset="images/features/ElementsDark.png"
          media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
          />
          <img

          src="images/features/ElementsLight.png"
          />
        </picture>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Describe elements</h3>
        <p>
          Text for an element's label will be recognized automatically, just add additional properties.
        </p>
        <picture>
          <source
          srcset="images/features/DescriptionDark.png"
          media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
          />
          <img
          class="featureImage"
          src="images/features/DescriptionLight.png"
          />
        </picture>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Setup adjustable elements</h3>
        <p>
          Sliders or carousels are adjustable elements in terms of VoiceOver. Their values can be adjusted by vertical swipe.
        </p>
        <picture>
          <source
          srcset="images/features/ValueDark.png"
          media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
          />
          <img
          class="featureImage"
          src="images/features/ValueLight.png"
          />
        </picture>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Prototype on your iPhone</h3>
        <p>
          Save the document to iCloud and test on a real device with help from Handoff. Turn on VoiceOver to hear the result.
        </p>
        <picture>
          <img
          class="featureImage"
          src="images/features/Handoff.png"
          />
        </picture>
      </article>
    </div>

    <p>This process so simple that full-screen adaptation requires just two minutes:</p>

    <div class="video-container">
      <iframe 
        class="youtube-video"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vyth4tzGEXM" 
        title="YouTube video player" 
        frameborder="0" 
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" 
        allowfullscreen>
      </iframe>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Prototype</h2>

    <p>
    You can open any .vodesign document in VoiceOver Preview app and check how blind people hear your interface.</p>

    <div class="video-sample-container">
      <div class="video-sample-item">
        <video class="video-phone-recording"
          width="300" height="649"

        <p class="video-caption">The sample of screen without proper accessible layout: a lot of elements, no labels, the structure is miracle.</p>

        </video>

        <p class="video-caption">After adaptation we have reduced number of elements, all of them have labels, the app become easier to use by hearing.</p>
      </div>  
    </div>

    <article class="special-announcement">
      <h3>A lot of samples</h3>
      <p>Couple of videos that you've seen are just a samples from the app. At the begging of your learning you can check samples of full-scenario adaptation for several apps. Also, on different languages.</p>

    </article>

      <p><b>Hint:</b> save files to iCloud, then you will be able to open files <a href="https://support.apple.com/ru-ru/HT209455">by Handoff.</a></p>
      
      <p>If you have great samples of accessible layout you can share it with others, just <a class="special-announcement-link" href="https://github.com/VODGroup/VoiceOverSamples">add samples to the repository.</a> Your samples will be visible is the app and helps other people to better understand VoiceOver rules.</p>

      <p>If you learn VoiceOver first time you can start from video "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDm7GiKra28">How to navigate your iPhone or iPad with VoiceOver</a>". Other videos from playlist also great!</p>

    <h2>Дизайните и тестируйте прямо на айпаде</h2>

    <p>Вы можете рисовать и сразу проверять разметку на айпаде. С поддержкой Apple Pencil работа оживает на кончиках пальцев</p>

    <p><b>Совет:</b> настройте быстрое включение VoiceOver на тройное нажатие кнопки.</p>

      <h2>Send your design to developers</h2>

      <p>After prototyping you can send the document to developer. It's not so cool like link-for-everybody like a Figma, but you can attach file to task-tracker :D</p>

      <p>But we have another offer - the book "<a href="https://rubanov.dev/a11y-book/">About accessibility on iOS</a>". It's on Russian, but we are working on translation and you can check code examples for free!

  <section>
    <h2>Open source</h2>

    <p>We have a lot of plans to help other designers and developers work with accessibility, but it would be hard to achieve alone. If are able to code you can help us by joining to development <a href="https://github.com/VODGroup/VoiceOverDesigner">at repository.</a>
    <p>
      Maintainers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://twitter.com/akaDuality">Mikhail Rubanov</a> — the main programmer, author of the book "About accessibility on iOS"</li>
      <li><a href="https://twitter.com/drucelweisse">Andrey Protnikov</a> — first developer how help the project brings to reality.</li>
      <li><a href="https://twitter.com/bbsody">Maxim Melnikov</a> — designer how draw such beautiful icon for our app.</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Also you can help by describing a bug or inspires us by your idea or feature-request.</p>

        <h3>Fix some bugs</h3>
        <p>
          We have just released our application and of cause we have unexpected bugs. We have tested a lot, who knows what could happen with real people.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>iPad's version</h3>
        <p>
          During the development process we understood that you can design and check the result on a single device – iPad! A lot of thing have already done, but we should tweak some few details for better experience.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Figma integration</h3>
        <p>
          It will be naturally for designers to add accessible layout not in separate application, but directly in Figma. We are going to to so and remove existence of separate files, everything should be on cloud.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Auto-tests for VoiceOver</h3>
        <p>
          Do not broke accessibility with new release is one of the main properties of accessible product. We would like to provide possibility to generate test cases directly from design and simplify automation as a result.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Art-boards</h3>
        <p>
          At this moment you can add layout just for single screen, but we would like to link several screens in single document and make interactive prototypes.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Full support for accessible technologies</h3>
        <p>
          The app is created around VoiceOver, but we are going to add support for other properties of Voice Control and Switch Control. Also, the app should be fully accessible for all people.
        </p>
      </article>
    </div>

    <p>
      We have not dates for this features and it's just a feature plans, but with your help we certainly can achieve that. Tell your friends about application and we will see that we have created important project.
